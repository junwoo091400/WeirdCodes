## KEB Hana Card IPinside application

When you need to use KEB Hana Bank's card, on Linux platform it directs you to this script (which doesn't get downloaded lmao), for the security program: [THIS](./Hanacard_security_program/IPinside-LWS.x86_64.20.rpm).

The raw URL to download this is: https://acs.hanacard.co.kr:9643/pay3DS/ipinside2/down/IPinside-LWS.x86_64.20.rpm
